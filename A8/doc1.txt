For although a man is judged by his actions,
by what he has said and done, a man judges
himself by what he is willing to do, by what
he might have said, or might have done â€“ a judgment
that is necessarily hampered, though only by the scope
and limits of his imagination, but by the ever-changing
measure of his doubt and self-esteem.
