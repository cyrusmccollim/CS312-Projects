This was a pretty cool project that showed me how search engines work under the hood. I had no idea that the basic concept was so straightforward with just making a map that connects words to the documents they appear in.
The trickiest part was getting the search logic right in the search() method. At first I thought I could just grab all documents that had any of the query words. But then I realized that wasn't right and I needed to find documents that have ALL the query words. That's why I used retainAll() to keep narrowing down the results. The Document iterator also gave me some trouble at first, but once I found the correct RegEx to use, the rest fell into place pretty smoothly.
The stop list feature made sense. It saves time and memory by skipping super common words like "the" and "and" that show up everywhere anyway.
I also appreciate how perfect HashMaps and HashSets work for this. They let me quickly look up documents for each word, and HashSets made it easy to track unique documents without duplicates.
I did not write the milestones until after I finished the implementation. However, I made sure to outline the order in which I attacked this problem and where I chose to do the intermediary tests.
