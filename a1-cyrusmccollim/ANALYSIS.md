**Client Approaches You**

Client: Hi! I heard you were a software developer. I need a program for tracking points.

You: You heard right! But, uh, what kind of points?  
Client: Well, I'm doing some graphing and sometimes I need *Polar* points and sometimes I need *Cartesian* points.

You: Hmm, well, okay, well, what makes up a point then?  
Client: A polar point has an angle *θ* and a radius *ρ*, while a cartesian point has *x* and *y* coordinates.

You: Right, I remember that from math class. What did you want to be able to do with a point?  
Client: Translate and rotate them.

You: Translate? Like from French? What does that mean for a point?  
Client: Translating a ploint means *moving* a point! Translating a cartesian point by the amount *(by_x, by_y)*, adds *by_x* to the point's *x* value and *by_y* to
its *y* value. Translating a polar point by the amount *(by_x, by_y)* can be accomplished by converting the point to a cartesian point, doing the translation, and then converting it back.

You: Suuure...and rotating means...  
Client: Rotating a cartesian point by *θ* degrees updates *x* to be *x × cos(θ ) − y × sin(θ )* and *y* to be *y = x × sin(θ ) + y × cos(θ )*. Rotating a polar point adds *θ* to the point's angle.

You: Okay, sure, I think I got it now. But what commands should you be able to issue?  
Client: Oh, nothing for now, just give me code that can do it and maybe something that proves it works and we'll be square.

You: Great. One last thing, when do you need this by?  
Client: If we could talk about the design on 9/13 at about 7:00 AM and maybe get a final product on 9/20 at 7:00 AM that'd be perfect.

You: I can do that!
