I honestly just dove straight into coding without planning anything. I did not write milestones or extra tests. I think this worked out okay since the main challenge wasn't really about overarching program design, but figuring out how to make the polynomial math work properly. I also skipped OOA/OOD. The relationships were pretty straightforward since we're just modeling basic algebra. The interesting part was actually implementing the polynomial arithmetic (getting insert() to maintain terms in descending order, handling edge cases like zero coefficients, and making sure toString() formats everything properly). I spent way more time than I'd like to admit fixing bugs where terms weren't combining correctly during multiplication. The ArrayList vs. LinkedList performance difference during K3 testing was definitely unexpected. It was a good reminder that implementation details matter. All in all, I'm sure that my solution is far from the most efficient (for instance a little improvement could be implementing binary insertion for `insert(Term term)`), but it was still very satisfying to at least get things working and see all of those tests pass.
