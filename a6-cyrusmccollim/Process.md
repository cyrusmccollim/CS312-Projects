While I once again skipped writing milestones, OOA/OOD, or formal tests, I did rely on print statements to debug and make sure my sorting was working correctly. This ended up being much more straightforward than I initially feared, but I did get stuck for a while on one specific issue which was figuring out how to properly "delete" nodes that had no parents or children in remove(). My first implementation would leave those nodes hanging around in the tree, which caused weird duplicate values when filling the numbers from the original list. Once I figured out that though the rest fell into place pretty naturally. I think my casual approach of going right into it and using print statements occasionally for debugging worked out okay this time, though I'm sure someone more methodical could have gotten there with fewer headaches.
