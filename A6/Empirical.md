### Empirical Analysis
Input size and sorting time.

| N          | Time (ms)  |
|------------|------------|
| 4,500,000  | T = 3,188  |
| 9,000,000  | T = 7,819  |
| 18,000,000 | T = 16,793 |
| 36,000,000 | T = 37,391 |

*It appears that as the input size doubles, approximately so does the sorting time. This suggests that the time complexity of the algorithm I have implemented is O(n).*
